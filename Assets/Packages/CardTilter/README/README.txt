Components involved with tilt rotation (and other aspects) can be found in 'Components' folder.

Example scenes making use of the components can be found in 'Examples' folder.

To get started in your own project, add the components to one of your objects, and tweak them 
to behave as desired!

If all you want is for an object to "tilt" towards its direction of movement, just the 
"TiltRotationComponent" can be attached to achieve your desired effect with tweaking.

When referencing components inside of your own scripts, make sure to use the 'Fizzik' namespace.
